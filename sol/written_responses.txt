Task 3B:
We have chosen to defend Time. We feel that it benefits the customers and drivers more to expend the least amount of
time on each order. If an order takes less time, the customer is more satisfied with the arrival of their order in a
timely manner, and the driver is able to take more orders in the same block of time that they are working, allowing for
the potential for more earnings.
One concern is fuel-efficiency. Many times, the fastest routes could involve interstate highway travel that adds
unnecessary mileage onto a trip, requiring more fuel.
Additionally, driving with excessive maneuvers and turns could contribute to traffic and gridlock in urban areas. These
undesirable developments will not reflect well upon the company.

Task 3C:
- drivers
- customers
- restaurant management
- restaurant staff
- the city / municipality
- developers who are employed
- residents of the municipality

Task 3D:
The provided stakeholders are simply more specific than ours. We thought in broad terms of how the app would immediately
impact the surrounding and affected community while this list goes a bit further and gives more details.

Task 3E:
Our choice prioritizes the drivers, customers, and restaurants who participate in the app. This is because decreased
time per order will result in more capacity for orders. That can make customers happier, produce more revenue for
restaurants, and create opportunities for drivers. Additionally, increased revenue and good reputation will help the
developers and executives who provide the app.
At the same time, pedestrians and drivers will be adversely affected. They will have to deal with increased traffic that
is not necessarily efficient traffic in mileage. Additionally, non-participating restaurants will lose market-share
to those who participate. This could cause them to be at a disadvantage economically.
